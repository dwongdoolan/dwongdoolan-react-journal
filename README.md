# dwongdoolan-react-journal (Journal App)

This is simple single-page web application with a registration page and allows the user to make text-based journal entries.
This project has React 17.0.1 UI and no server backend. When the app is refreshed the data is lost.

On the registration page, please enter a Username, Password, Name and Bio Line. Click on Submit Registration.

The journal page has three components
1) Add a new journal entry
2) List of existing journal entries
3) View journal entries
